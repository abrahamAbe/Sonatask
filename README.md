Sonatask
========
Basic ToDo application coded with angularJS.

To execute it, clone the project to Aptana Studio and run the "index.html", that should take you to the login page from where 
you can navigate to sign up and create an account.

All users are managed by the "UserApp" module and all the tasks are stored in "Parse.com" using their Restful services.
